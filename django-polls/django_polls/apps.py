# Explaination
""" 
The code you've provided seems to be a part of a Django application and is related to configuring the "polls" app. Let me break down the code line by line:

1. `class PollsConfig(AppConfig):`
   - This line defines a class named `PollsConfig` that inheritzs from `AppConfig`. In Django, an `AppConfig` is a configuration class for a Django application.

2. `    default_auto_field = "django.db.models.BigAutoField"`
   - This line sets the default auto-generated field for models in this app to be a "BigAutoField." In Django, an auto field is used for automatically generating a unique value when a new object is created. The "BigAutoField" is a type of auto field suitable for large integer values.

3. `    name = "polls"`
   - This line specifies the name of the Django app. In this case, the app is named "polls." The app name is used as an identifier in various places within Django projects.

So, in summary, this code is defining a configuration for the "polls" app in a Django project. It specifies that the default auto-generated field for models in this app should be a "BigAutoField," and it sets the name of the app to "polls."
